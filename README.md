# bmstats
A simple web based scoreboard for the [RankMe Kento Edition](https://github.com/rogeraabbccdd/Kento-Rankme) SourceMod plugin for CSGO.

Built with ASP .NET MVC 5 and uses [Bootstrap Table](https://bootstrap-table.com/) along with [SteamWebAPI2](https://github.com/babelshift/SteamWebAPI2).

Requires a [Steam Web API Key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) and a MySQL database for the RankMe plugin, both of which should be specified in the `SpecialAppSettings.config` file.

**Disclaimer:** I am not a programmer and the code in this project probably goes against many best practices in software design. Even so, comments and criticisms are appreciated.
